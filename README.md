# Spectral Hashing

This is a Python implementation of Y. Weiss's
[Spectral Hashing](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/SpectralHashing/sh.zip).

## TIPs

1. The eigen vectors solved by Python and MATLAB may have different sign, thus the binary code generated by Python and MATLAB might be different. However, the result of `hammingDist(B, B)` with `B` from either Python or MABLAB will get the same results.

2. By manually adjust the sign of the eigen vectors in Python (`trainSH`), you can get the same binary code from Python as from MABLAB.
